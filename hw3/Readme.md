Assignment 03 - the Enigma
===================

Please read **"Intro_Enigma.pptx"** first and figure out the secret behind the Enigma carefully.

Extend the example codes (Enigma.h & Enigma_Base.h) and provide your own version of Enigma encoder. This program should encode string from a file (original_data.txt) and output **encoded string** to a file, too. (encoded_data.txt).

Please follow the example codes and create derived class for each component of Enigma. 

A win32 executable program has been provide in the ./example/TAsEnigma.exe. Also, a referenced Main.cpp has been provided, too.

In the end, please follow rules strictly. (Include 作業繳交規範 by 徐皓)

----------
A common workflow of preparation of your homework
-------------
(In the following text, we assume your student ID is s1234567 and # is the NUMBER of homework in one digit, Please replace it with your student ID and follow the steps exactly!)


1. Clone your private repository of hw# to your home directory on server or another suitable location from our organization on GitHub (https://github.com/YZU-CSE-CS114-Computer-Programming-II)

2. After you start to deal with your homework, add a file s1234567hw#_main.cpp as your main program and s1234567hw#_report.md as your report (optional). Then, commit it! **(Don't forget to push it onto GitHub, too)** 
**Any of your code should be prefixed with "1234567hw#_"**.
**For example: s1234567hw3_Enigma.h, s1234567hw3_Enigma_Base.h**

3. Complete your program and write your report (if necessary) with Markdown.
*. Please commit your homework when you have any progress (The project should be compilable 可編譯).

4. Make sure you have complete the assignment and prepare a clear demo in your report. **Do it ON YOUR OWN and ON TIME.** (You have **only 2 chances in this semester** to request additional time for doing your homework, each chance will give you additional **24Hours**. Please contact the TAs **BEFORE** the deadline and use it wisely)
